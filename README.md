# auto-camp
Chrome extension to auto-play albums from Bandcamp

Currently it has the functionality to scrape the song duration information and HTML objects to play songs from the BandCamp site, and
play through the entire album automatically. It also has basic media player tools such as pausing/resuming and skipping and resuming 
songs. 

The latest update uses React to render the elements and added new functionality including:

A track list from which you can choose songs
Song title, artist name, and album info for current music

Feel free to port this over to other browsers if you would like, but just list me in the credits :)
