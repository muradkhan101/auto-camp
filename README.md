# auto-camp
Chrome extension to auto-play albums from Bandcamp

Currently it has the functionality to scrape the song duration information and HTML objects to play songs from the BandCamp site, and
play through the entire album automatically. It also has basic media player tools such as pausing/resuming and skipping and resuming 
songs. 

Feel free to port this over to other browser if you would like, but just list me in the credits :)
